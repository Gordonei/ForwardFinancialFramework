In Progress Log
---------------
Comments for on-going work go here.

Tasks
-----
1) Change Java class and source file names to be compliant with the lower case scheme used in the c and Python code. [DONE]
2) Maxeler Host code generation for the Monte Carlo Solver
3) Maxeler Kernel code generation for the Monte Carlo Solver*
4) Automating Maxeler compiler flow for the Monte Carlo Solver**

Tasks' Notes
----------
* Support for multiple derivatives depending on the same underlying - issue with numerical accurcracy making multirate time progression difficult
** Link to broader effort to support IP execution?

Proposed
--------
1) Sort out path issues in Solver generation and compilation code
2) Separate generation, compilation and execution from main solver class.
  2.1) Generation goes to additional classes
  2.2) Compilation and Execution made the responsibility of platform class
