In Progress Log
---------------
Comments for on-going work go here.

Tasks
-----
1) Support the calculation of 95% confidence intervals for the pricing tasks done [IN PROGRESS]
2) Create scripts for generating Perato surfaces for confidence intervals, latency and cost
3) Generate experimental scripts for verifying the perato surfaces created

Proposed
--------
1) Improve the monitoring infrastructure - emphasis on resource utilisation
2) Support compilation and execution over-IP

Put Off
-------
* Support for multiple derivatives depending on the same underlying with different expiry dates - issue with numerical accurcracy making multirate time progression difficult by comparison to the CPU. For now assuming that shared underlyings only have the same time period and points.
