In Progress Log

Comments for on-going work go here.

Tasks
-----
1) Implementation->User Space Parameter Transformation
1.1) Support the calculation of 95% confidence intervals for the pricing tasks done [DONE]
1.2) Create scripts for generating Perato surfaces for confidence intervals, latency and cost [IN PROGRESS]
1.3) Generate experimental scripts for verifying the perato surfaces created [IN PROGRESS]
2) OpenCL Support
2.1) Support Basic Underlyings and Options [DONE]
2.2) Use offline compilation [DONE]
2.3) Support Kaiserslatuarn Set [IN PROGRESS]

Proposed
--------
1) Improve the monitoring infrastructure - emphasis on resource utilisation
2) Support compilation and execution over-IP
3) Allow for the Monte Carlo Implementation to be "seeded" with values for each derivative - should this be done throught the derivative objects? This suggest persistance between solvers

Put Off
-------
* Support for multiple derivatives depending on the same underlying with different expiry dates - issue with numerical accurcracy making multirate time progression difficult by comparison to the CPU. For now assuming that shared underlyings only have the same time period and points.
