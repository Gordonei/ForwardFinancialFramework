In Progress Log

Comments for on-going work go here.

Tasks
-----
1) Support the calculation of 95% confidence intervals for the pricing tasks done [DONE]
2) Create scripts for generating Perato surfaces for confidence intervals, latency and cost [IN PROGRESS]
3) Generate experimental scripts for verifying the perato surfaces created [IN PROGRESS]

Proposed
--------
1) Improve the monitoring infrastructure - emphasis on resource utilisation
2) Support compilation and execution over-IP
3) Replace the use of the Box-Muller transform with the Zigarat for the URN to GRN in the CPU implementation
4) Allow for the Monte Carlo Implementation to be "seeded" with values for each derivative - should this be done throught the derivative objects? This suggest persistance between solvers
5) Differentiate between options that incorporate path points into their definition (e.g. barrier or asian) and how many path points are defined for the Monte Carlo Solver.

Put Off
-------
* Support for multiple derivatives depending on the same underlying with different expiry dates - issue with numerical accurcracy making multirate time progression difficult by comparison to the CPU. For now assuming that shared underlyings only have the same time period and points.
