In Progress Log
---------------
Comments for on-going work go here.

Tasks
-----
1) Change Java class and source file names to be compliant with the lower case scheme used in the c and Python code. [DONE]
2) Change Monte Carlo and Multicore Monte Carlo Solver infrastructure to allow for easier resuse of multicore code in Maxeler Code Generation [DONE]
3) Maxeler Host code generation for the Monte Carlo Solver [DONE]
4) Maxeler Kernel code generation for the Monte Carlo Solver [IN PROGRESS]
5) Automating Maxeler compiler flow for the Monte Carlo Solver*

Tasks' Notes
------------
* Link to broader effort to support over-IP execution?

Proposed
--------
1) Improve the monitoring infrastructure - emphasis on resource utilisation
2) Cleanup behaviour for solvers
3) Modify Monte Carlo algorithm to accurracy on demand 

Put Off
-------
* Support for multiple derivatives depending on the same underlying - issue with numerical accurcracy making multirate time progression difficult by comparison to the CPU. For now assuming that shared underlyings only have the same time period and points.
