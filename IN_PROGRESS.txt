In Progress Log
---------------
Comments for on-going work go here.

Tasks
-----
1) Change Java class and source file names to be compliant with the lower case scheme used in the c and Python code.
2) Maxeler Host code generation for the Monte Carlo Solver
3) Maxeler Kernel code generation for the Monte Carlo Solver*
4) Automating Maxeler compiler flow for the Monte Carlo Solver**

Notes
-----
* Support for multiple derivatives depending on the same underlying - issue with numerical accurcracy making time progress difficult
** Possibly link to broader effort to support IP execution?
